# Enharmonicism

**Idea**
- Mathematical Music Theory has largely focused on Pitch-Class Sets due to Set Theory.
- Distributions of pitch-classes have been rarely considered but gain more and more importance with corpus studies.
- Scale Theory has shown that certain scales have the same shape in chromatic and diatonic (fifths) order on a circle $Z_{12}$
- These are in particular the symmetric (and nearly symmetric) scales.
- For all other scales, the shapes differ greatly.
- This transformation $x \\mapsto 7x \\mod 12$ can also be applied to Pitch Class distributions
- Hypothesis: The larger the similarity between both orderings, the more similar are chromatic and diatonic order,
implying that the essential steps are not diatonic steps but chromatic semitones.
- Can we see a historical trend?
